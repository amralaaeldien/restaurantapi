# RestaurantAPI
A Django Rest Framework API for restaurants
You can access the main API at 
 https://restaurantapidjango.herokuapp.com/restaurants/ 
 
 
You will find each restaurant has a set of tables where you can find available tables in each restaurant where you can view each at 
> restaurantapidjango.herokuapp.com/restaurants/ID of restaurant/tables/

You will also find each restaurant has a set of ratings where you can each view at
> restaurantapidjango.herokuapp.com/restaurants/ID of restaurant/rates/

and you can find the average rating in the `overall_rating` attribute on each restaurant which is updated automatically when you add another rating
